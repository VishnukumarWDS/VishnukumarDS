    "Multiprocessing is a way of achieving parallelism in Python, where multiple processes are created to execute tasks simultaneously on a computer's multiple CPUs or cores. In multiprocessing, each process runs independently and has its memory space, and can communicate with other processes by using interprocess communication (IPC) techniques such as pipes, queues, and shared memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing is useful because it can significantly speed up the execution of CPU-bound tasks, such as complex mathematical calculations, data processing, and machine learning algorithms. By dividing a large task into smaller sub-tasks and assigning each sub-task to a separate process, multiprocessing can take advantage of the available CPUs/cores, thereby reducing the overall execution time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing is also useful for tasks that involve blocking operations, such as I/O operations or waiting for network requests. By using multiprocessing, you can perform these operations in separate processes without blocking the main process, thereby improving the overall responsiveness of your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides a multiprocessing module that makes it easy to create and manage processes in Python programs. The module provides various features such as process spawning, process communication, synchronization primitives, and shared memory."

    "CPU utilization: Multiprocessing can take advantage of multiple CPUs or cores, while multithreading can only take advantage of a single CPU or core.\n",

    "Overhead: Multiprocessing has a higher overhead than multithreading, as each process requires its own memory space and resources, while threads share resources within a process.\n",

    "Inter-process communication: Processes communicate with each other using IPC mechanisms such as pipes, queues, and shared memory, while threads communicate using shared memory.\n",
