    "#### The close() function is used to close a file that has been opened in Python. It is important to close a file after you are done with it for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource Management: When a file is opened, resources on the system are allocated to manage it, such as memory and file descriptors. Failing to close a file can result in a resource leak, where these resources are not freed even after the file is no longer in use. Over time, this can lead to performance issues and even cause the system to crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Integrity: When you open a file in write mode, changes are made to the file immediately, but they may not be saved to disk until the file is closed. If your program terminates unexpectedly or crashes, the changes may not be saved. Closing the file ensures that the changes are saved to disk and that the data is properly stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "File Locking: Some file systems lock files when they are opened in certain modes, such as write mode. This ensures that no other process can modify the file while you are working with it. Failing to close a file can prevent other processes from accessing it, which can cause problems with data integrity and resource management.\n",
    "\n",
    "File Descriptor Limits: Most operating systems have limits on the number of open file descriptors that a single process can have at one time. Closing a file frees up a file descriptor, allowing you to open other files. If you do not close files that you no longer need, you may reach the limit and be unable to open any more files.\n"
