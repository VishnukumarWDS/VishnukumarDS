    "An example of an API being used in real life is in the context of online shopping. Online shopping platforms such as Amazon, eBay, and Walmart have APIs that allow third-party developers to access product information, inventory levels, pricing data, and other relevant details about the products that they sell. Developers can then use this information to build applications that help shoppers compare prices, find the best deals, and make more informed purchasing decisions. For example, a developer could build an app that aggregates information from multiple retailers' APIs to help shoppers find the lowest price for a particular item."

    "REST is an architectural style that is based on HTTP protocol and is commonly used for building web services. In a RESTful architecture, resources are identified by URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers), and interactions with those resources are performed using standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. RESTful services use a stateless client-server model, which means that the server does not keep track of the client's previous interactions. Instead, each request from the client contains all of the necessary information to complete the request.\n",

    "SOAP is an XML-based messaging protocol used for exchanging structured data between applications. In a SOAP architecture, a SOAP message is sent from the client to the server, which contains information about the operation to be performed, along with any required input parameters. The server then sends a SOAP response message back to the client, which contains the result of the operation.\n",

    "Message Format:\n",
    "RESTful web services usually use lightweight message formats like JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) or XML (Extensible Markup Language) for data exchange. SOAP web services use XML as a message format, which can be verbose and complex.\n",
