    "Q1. The wine quality data set contains 12 features, including 11 input variables and 1 output variable (quality). The input variables describe various chemical properties of the wine, including fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, and alcohol. The output variable, quality, is a rating on a scale from 0 to 10 assigned by human tasters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each feature plays an important role in predicting the quality of wine. For example, fixed acidity affects the wine's tartness and can contribute to the perception of sourness or bitterness. Volatile acidity is a measure of the wine's acidity due to the presence of volatile acids, such as acetic acid. Citric acid can contribute to the wine's freshness and can balance out the sourness of the other acids. Residual sugar affects the sweetness of the wine, while chlorides can contribute to a salty taste. Free sulfur dioxide and total sulfur dioxide are measures of the wine's sulfur content, which can affect its aroma and flavor. Density is a measure of the wine's mass per unit volume and can affect its mouthfeel. pH is a measure of the wine's acidity or basicity, which can affect its taste and stability. Finally, sulphates can help to prevent spoilage and oxidation of the wine, while alcohol content can affect its body and mouthfeel.\n"

    "Q2. During the feature engineering process, missing data in the wine quality data set can be handled using various imputation techniques. One common technique is mean imputation, where the missing values are replaced with the mean value of the corresponding feature. Another technique is median imputation, where the missing values are replaced with the median value of the corresponding feature. A third technique is regression imputation, where a regression model is used to predict the missing values based on the values of the other features. A fourth technique is K-nearest neighbor imputation, where the missing values are replaced with the average value of the K-nearest data points based on a distance metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each imputation technique has its own advantages and disadvantages. Mean and median imputation are simple and fast, but can lead to biased estimates and may not capture the true distribution of the data. Regression imputation can capture the underlying relationships between features, but requires a large enough sample size and assumes a linear relationship between the features. K-nearest neighbor imputation can capture the local patterns in the data, but can be sensitive to the choice of distance metric and the value of K.\n"
