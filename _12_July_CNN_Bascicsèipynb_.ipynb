    "    ## Understanding Pooling and Padding in CNN\n",
    "Pooling and Padding in CNN:\n",
    "1. Pooling:\n",
    "Purpose: Pooling layers reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps, reducing the computational load and controlling overfitting.\n",
    "Benefits: It provides translation invariance, reduces the number of parameters, and helps capture the most important features.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Min Pooling vs. Max Pooling:\n",
    "Min Pooling: Takes the minimum value from the pooling window.\n",
    "Max Pooling: Takes the maximum value from the pooling window.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Padding:\n",
    "Concept: Padding involves adding additional pixels around the input image, allowing convolutional operations to be applied to border pixels and retaining spatial information.\n",
    "Significance: It helps control the spatial dimensions of the output feature maps and preserves information at the borders of the input image.\n",
    "Zero-padding vs. Valid-padding:\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Zero-padding adds zeros around the input image, maintaining the spatial dimensions of the output feature maps.\n",
    "Valid-padding does not add any extra pixels, leading to a reduction in spatial dimensions.\n",
