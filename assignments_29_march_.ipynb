    "Q1. Lasso Regression, also known as L1 regularization, is a regression technique used for feature selection and regularization. It adds a penalty term to the regression cost function, which encourages the model to reduce the coefficients of less important features to zero. The main difference between Lasso Regression and other regression techniques, such as linear regression or Ridge Regression, is that Lasso Regression can perform feature selection by automatically shrinking the coefficients of irrelevant features to zero, effectively eliminating them from the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. The main advantage of using Lasso Regression in feature selection is that it can automatically select the most relevant features by setting the coefficients of irrelevant features to zero. This helps in reducing the complexity and dimensionality of the model, improving its interpretability, and potentially enhancing its generalization performance by reducing overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. The interpretation of coefficients in Lasso Regression is similar to linear regression. The magnitude of the coefficient indicates the strength of the relationship between the corresponding feature and the target variable. However, due to the L1 regularization, some coefficients may be exactly zero, indicating that the corresponding feature has been eliminated from the model. The sign of the non-zero coefficients indicates the direction of the relationship (positive or negative) between the feature and the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. In Lasso Regression, the tuning parameter that can be adjusted is commonly denoted as lambda (λ) or alpha (α). It controls the strength of the regularization penalty. A higher value of lambda leads to stronger regularization, resulting in more coefficients being pushed towards zero. Conversely, a lower value of lambda reduces the regularization effect, allowing more features to have non-zero coefficients. The selection of the optimal value for lambda is typically done using techniques like cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Lasso Regression can handle non-linear regression problems to some extent, but its primary strength lies in feature selection rather than modeling non-linear relationships. If the relationship between the features and the target variable is highly non-linear, it may be more appropriate to use other regression techniques, such as polynomial regression or non-linear regression models like decision trees, support vector regression, or neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. The main difference between Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression lies in the type of regularization penalty used. Ridge Regression uses L2 regularization, which adds the sum of squared coefficients multiplied by a regularization parameter to the cost function. Lasso Regression, on the other hand, uses L1 regularization, which adds the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients multiplied by a regularization parameter to the cost function. The L1 regularization has the effect of setting some coefficients exactly to zero, resulting in feature selection, whereas L2 regularization only shrinks the coefficients towards zero but does not eliminate them entirely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. Yes, Lasso Regression can handle multicollinearity in the input features. Multicollinearity refers to the presence of high correlation between independent variables. Lasso Regression's regularization penalty has the effect of shrinking the coefficients, and in the presence of multicollinearity, it tends to distribute the importance among the correlated features. As a result, some of the correlated features may have their coefficients reduced to zero, effectively selecting one feature over others. This way, Lasso Regression can indirectly handle multicollinearity by providing a mechanism for feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. The optimal value of the regularization parameter (lambda) in Lasso Regression is typically chosen using techniques like cross-validation. Cross-validation involves splitting the data into multiple training and validation sets, fitting the model with different values of lambda on the training sets, and evaluating the model's performance on the validation sets. The value of lambda that gives the best performance, as determined by a suitable evaluation metric (e.g., mean squared error, R-squared), is considered the optimal value. Alternatively, techniques like grid search or model selection algorithms can be used to automate the process of selecting the optimal lambda value."
