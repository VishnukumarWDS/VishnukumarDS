For example, encoding the colors \"red,\" \"green,\" and \"blue\" as 0, 1, and 2, respectively.\n",

    "Ordinal Encoding: Ordinal Encoding is used when the categorical variables have an inherent order or rank. In this method, each category is assigned a unique integer value based on its order or position. It is suitable for ordinal categorical variables where the categories have a meaningful order.
