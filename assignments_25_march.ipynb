    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "# Determine the range of flight prices\n",
    "print('Minimum Price:', flight_df['Price'].min())\n",

    "Q6. To identify the peak travel season, you can analyze the following features:\n",
    "- Departure date: You can examine the distribution of flight prices by departure date to identify any patterns or trends.\n",
    "- Destination: You can analyze the distribution of flight prices by destination to identify any popular travel locations.\n",
    "- Seasonal events: You can examine any seasonal events or holidays that may impact travel demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "To present your findings, you can create visualizations such as line charts or heat maps to show the distribution of flight prices by date or destination. You can also use descriptive statistics such as mean and median prices to highlight any peak periods.\n",

    "Q7. To identify trends in flight prices, you can analyze the following features:\n",
    "- Time of year: You can examine the distribution of flight prices by month or season to identify any seasonal trends.\n",
    "- Departure and arrival times: You can analyze the distribution of flight prices by departure and arrival times to identify any peak periods.\n",
    "- Airline: You can analyze the distribution of flight prices by airline to identify any pricing strategies or trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "To present your findings, you can create visualizations such as line charts or scatter plots to show the trend of flight prices over time. You can also use regression analysis to identify any significant factors that affect flight prices.\n",

    "Q8.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a data scientist, there are several features that I would analyze to identify the factors that affect flight prices. These features include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Departure and arrival airports: The distance between the two airports can affect the price of the flight.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Date and time of travel: Flights during peak travel times, such as weekends or holidays, are likely to be more expensive than flights during off-peak times.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Number of stops: Flights with more stops are often cheaper than direct flights.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Airline carrier: The reputation and pricing strategy of the airline carrier can also affect the price of the flight.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Seasonality: Travel patterns and demand for flights can vary depending on the season, which can also affect flight prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyze these features, I would use statistical techniques such as regression analysis, correlation analysis, and data visualization. This would help me identify which features have the strongest correlation with flight prices and which ones are less significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once I have identified the factors that affect flight prices, I would present my findings to the management team in a clear and concise manner. I would use data visualization techniques such as graphs and charts to help them understand the relationship between the different factors and flight prices. I would also provide recommendations based on my analysis, such as pricing strategies or changes to the airline's route network, to help the airline company optimize their revenue and improve their competitiveness in the market."
