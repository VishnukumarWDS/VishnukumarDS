For example, violations of normality can be caused by outliers or skewed distributions, while violations of equal variances can occur when the groups being compared have different variances. Violations of independence can occur when data points are not truly independent, such as in repeated measures designs or in time series data."

For example, removing participants with missing data can reduce statistical power and introduce bias if the missing data are not missing completely at random.
