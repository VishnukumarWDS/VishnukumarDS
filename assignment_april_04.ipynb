    "Q1. Describe the decision tree classifier algorithm and how it works to make predictions.\n",
    "What is a Decision Tree Classifier?\n",
    "A Decision Tree Classifier is a type of machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It works by splitting the dataset into subsets based on the value of input features, using a tree-like model of decisions. The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.\n",
    "\n",
    "How it Works\n",
    "Starting at the Root: The algorithm begins at the root node and evaluates each feature to decide which one to split on. It selects the feature that provides the best separation of the data based on a specific criterion (e.g., Gini impurity, information gain).\n",
    "\n",
    "Splitting the Data: The data is split into branches based on feature values. For example, in binary classification, it might split data into two subsets at each node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursive Process: This process of evaluating features and splitting data continues recursively for each subset until one of the stopping conditions is met:\n",
    "\n",
    "All data points in a node belong to the same class.\n",
    "There are no remaining features to split.\n",
    "A maximum depth is reached, preventing the tree from growing too large.\n",
    "Leaf Nodes: When no further splits are possible, the nodes become leaf nodes and are assigned a class label based on the majority class of data points within them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Making Predictions: To make a prediction for a new instance, start at the root node and traverse the tree based on the feature values of the instance until you reach a leaf node. The class label at the leaf node is the predicted label.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "For example, in a decision tree used to predict whether a person will buy a product, the root node might evaluate whether the person's age is above or below a certain threshold. Subsequent nodes might evaluate their income or whether they have bought similar products before.\n",
