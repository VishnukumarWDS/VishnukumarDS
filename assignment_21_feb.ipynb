    "Parsing HTML: This method involves parsing the HTML of a web page to extract the relevant data. Web scrapers use libraries like BeautifulSoup and lxml to parse the HTML and extract the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using APIs: Some websites offer APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that allow developers to access data in a structured format. APIs are typically more reliable and faster than web scraping, but not all websites offer them.\n",
